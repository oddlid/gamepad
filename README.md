# GamePad - a game round calculator

This app intends to be a replacement for pen and paper when tracking scores when playing real life
games.
The user defines game names and players, and it can be used for anything where you need to add or
remove points for players in a round of a given game.
Names of games and players will be saved in a local database, and persisted until the user chooses
to modify or delete it. Points for players during an active round is only kept in memory until the
round is exited by pressing back in the active round screen, or by killing the app.
There's really not much more to it, as the intention is to be as generic as possible, so it's
usable for most games with scores.
